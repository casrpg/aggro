# Aggro Score Library
The Aggro Score Library is a tool designed for tabletop RPG players to determine which enemy will attack an NPC or monster during combat. This library is particularly useful for sandbox campaigns without a dungeon master.

The Aggro Score Library uses a scoring system to calculate which enemy will attack based on a variety of factors, including proximity, damage dealt, healing done, and other player actions. With this library, players can have a fair and balanced combat experience without the need for a dungeon master.

The library is easy to use, and can be integrated into any tabletop RPG system. Simply input the relevant data for each NPC or monster, and the Aggro Score Library will automatically calculate which enemy will attack next.

With the Aggro Score Library, players can focus on their characters and the story, without worrying about the mechanics of combat. Whether you're a seasoned player or a newcomer to tabletop RPGs, the Aggro Score Library is an essential tool for any sandbox campaign.
